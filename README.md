# kafka-quest

This repo contains quests for learning [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/). Currently, I design the quests based on my own needs. If you are new to Kafka, please start from [Intro to Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/intro).

## Getting started

To keep your environment clean, the quests need Docker installed in your machine. If you have not installed Docker, please visit [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

## Quests

* [Quest 01: Setup a cluster](/quest01/README.md)
* [Quest 02: Publish and consume messages](/quest02/README.md)
